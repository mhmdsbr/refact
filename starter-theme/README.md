## Getting Started

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Overview

Run step `#1`, `#2`, and `#3` quickly in one go ‚Äî Run inside local WP install's theme/plugin folder E.g. `/wp.local/wp-content/plugins/your-plugin` or `/wp.local/wp-content/themes/your-theme` directory.

```sh
# 1‚Äî Install WPGulp in your WordPress wp-content/themes/your-theme
npm install
# 2‚Äî Now configure variables inside the `wpgulp.config.js` file.
# 3‚Äî Start your npm build workflow.
npm start
```



In case you are an absolute beginner to the world of `Node.js`, JavaScript, and `npm` packages ‚Äî all you need to do is go to the Node's site [download + install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Node on your system. This will install both `Node.js` and `npm`, i.e., node package manager ‚Äî the command line interface of Node.js.

You can verify the install by opening your terminal app and typing...

```sh
node -v
# Results into v16.15.1 ‚Äî make sure you have Node >= 16 installed.

npm -v
# Results into 8.11.0 ‚Äî make sure you have npm >= 8 installed.
```

### ‚Üí `STEP #1` ‚Äî Get the Required Files

1. In the terminal go to the root folder of your WordPress theme
2. Copy the WPGulp project into your theme directory.

_It'll take a couple of minutes to install._

```sh
npm install
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  I'm assuming that there are no previously present similar files in the root of your folder. Otherwise, you need to merge these very carefully. E.g. You can include the `scripts`, `devDependencies` in your current `package.json` file and so on for other files. If you run the above command all similar files will be overwritten.

### ‚Üí `STEP #2` ‚Äî Editing the Project Variables

Configure the project paths and other variables inside the `wpgulp.config.js` file. This is a compulsory step.

### ‚Üí `STEP #3` ‚Äî Start your project

Once the installation is done, you can open your project (WordPress plugin/theme) folder and run the start script.

```sh
npm start

# To stop press CTRL (‚åÉ) + C
```
